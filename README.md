# Starbound-OutfitMerging
Merges two images for using Silverfeelin's generator

## NOW MERGED (so ironic) WITH [SILVERFEELIN'S OUTFIT GENERATOR](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-OutfitGenerator)

This tool is created to simplify the work for cutom tailors, who had to manually merge chest and pants frames piece by piece to use the result with [Silverfeelin's Outfit Generator](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-OutfitGenerator).

# Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Degranon/Starbound-OutfitMerging/releases/latest) and put the exe file wherever you want

# Usage
Simply drag and drop two images on top of the application: it will allow you to merge them together.
You have two options: for merging chest and pants images OR back and front sleeves.

# Special thanks
Special thanks to Silverfeelin for creating his awesome generator.
